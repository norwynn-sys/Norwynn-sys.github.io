        <h1>Hi! I am Crystal Jade C. Sabado</h1>
        <h3>A BACHELOR OF SCIENCE IN INFORMATION STUDENT.</h3>
        <p>I'm an Information Technology student at PHINMA - University of Pangasinan. I consider myself a responsible and orderly student who has a basic knowledge of programming, particularly Python, which is my first programming language to learn.
            Also, I am current learning framework called Kivy, which is quite difficult since this is my first time learning and using it. I'm a beginner in all of the aspects of being a programmer and making it. I want to learn more and understand each programming language that may help me in the future. I am good by myself, but I prefer to have a team that might help and encourage me to understand the world of programming and learn more from them.</p>
